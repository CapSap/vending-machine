This is a simple vanilla TS app to learn about manipulating the DOM with JS and to think about state.

## TS challenges
It was a little tricky getting the right types for Event objects. DOM selectors can return many different element, so something to think about. 


## To run
1. Clone the repo
2. run ```npm install```
3. run ```npm run dev``` (this will run the typescript compiler and watch for saved changes)
4. Open index.html in your browser or use your favourite live server tool
5. done!
